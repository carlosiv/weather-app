# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App Typescript](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

## What this App can do

1. At initial load, gets the current location of the user and load the data
2. The user can toggle dropdown to change location. (Local location only)
3. The user can view 5 weather days.
4. The user view a certain weather of a given day
5. The background of the app changes according to the time it is opened.

## What this App not. (TODO)

- App is not yet suited for viewing on small screens
- No catch route for invalid routes
- Location is limited to PH and cannot use outside the list
